### The Data is downloaded from the website our world in data which is a tabular representation of early covid-19 cases in India.

Here's what we can tell by looking at the dataframe:
• The file provides day-wise counts for COVID-19 in India
• The metrics reported are new cases, deaths, and patients cured
• Data is provided for 959 days: from Jan 30, 2020 to Sept 15, 2022

Keep in mind that these are officially reported numbers. The actual number of cases & deaths may be higher, as not all cases are diagnosed.
